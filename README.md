Rubik's Cube Solver - using Korf's IDA* Algorithm

• Modeled a virtual Rubik's Cube (3x3) in 3 different models/classes using standard
data-structures present in C++
• Achieved a solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 8 times,
using BFS, DFS and IDDFS algorithms
• Implemented the Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solving time of under 10
seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times
